			p(style="font-size:1.3em") Some of the current projects I'm working on are about how deep learning can be used to develop biomedical applications. For people unfamiliar with the term, deep learning means using large amounts of data to find values for the tunable parameters in a large neural network. The goal is to find values that will cause the neural network to perform well on the task we have in mind. For example, finding blood vessels in MRI data. 

			p(style="font-size:1.3em") In doing this kind of research, you inevitably end up having to write a lot of code to test out different neural network architectures, different optimization settings and many other things. To make things easier you typically use a code library that already has a lot of the functionality you need. The point is, having the right library can make all the difference between making your work easy, or difficult.

			p(style="font-size:1.3em") Up to now I have been using the <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/"> Caffe</a> library for most of my projects. Caffe is a neural network library written in C++ with support for training neural networks on GPUs. As a result it's fast and does a good job of making it possible to train some serious networks. However, I find it hard to write flexible code with Caffe. So whenever I want to try a lot of different experiements I end up having to write a lot of different code which is cumbersome. 

			p(style="font-size:1.3em")  Google recently announced the release of their new open-source software framework <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> with, among others, the goal of making deep learning research easier. Because of my frustrations with Caffe, I decided it would be a good time to experiment with Tensorflow. I think it's a very cool framework and with this blog post I want to share what I have learned about how Tensorflow works. That way, if you ever decide to look into it, you will hopefully have a head start.
